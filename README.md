This is my readme file for the team project simple sheel with Ibiso harrison
This readme file explains the codes of this project and it will contain the codes that;
1. passes the Betty checks
2. Writes a UNIX command line interpreter
3. simple shell 0.1+ that handles command lines with arguments
4. Simple shell 0.2+  which handles the PATH, and the fork must not be called if the commad line doesn't exist
5. Simple shell 0.3+ tha implement the exit built in that exists the shell, the use of exit, and does not handle any argument to the built in exit
6. Simple shell 0.4+ which implement the env built in, that prints the current environment
7. Simple shell 0.1.1 which handles;
Simple shell 0.1 +

Write your own getline function
Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call
You will need to use static variables
You are not allowed to use getline
You donâ€™t have to:

be able to move the cursor
8. Simple shell 0.2.1 which handles;
Simple shell 0.2 +

You are not allowed to use strtok
9. Simple shell 0.4.1 which handles;
Simple shell 0.4 +

handle arguments for the built-in exit
Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell
10. setenv, unsetenv which handles;
Simple shell 1.0 +

Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands

setenv
Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one
Command syntax: setenv VARIABLE VALUE
Should print something on stderr on failure
unsetenv
Remove an environment variable
Command syntax: unsetenv VARIABLE
Should print something on stderr on failure
11. cd which will handle;
Simple shell 1.0 +

Implement the builtin command cd:

Changes the current directory of the process.
Command syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]
If no argument is given to cd the command must be interpreted like cd $HOME
You have to handle the command cd -
You have to update the environment variable PWD when you change directory
man chdir, man getcwd
12. ; which will handle;
Simple shell 1.0 +
the commands separator ;
13.  && and || which handles;
Simple shell 1.0 +

Handle the && and || shell logical operators
14. alias which deals with;
Simple shell 1.0 +

Implement the alias builtin command
Usage: alias [name[='value'] ...]
alias: Prints a list of all aliases, one per line, in the form name='value'
alias name [name2 ...]: Prints the aliases name, name2, etc 1 per line, in the form name='value'
alias name='value' [...]: Defines an alias for each name whose value is given. If name is already an alias, replaces its value with value
15. Variables which deals with;
Simple shell 1.0 +

Handle variables replacement
Handle the $? variable
Handle the $$ variable
16. Comments which handles;
Simple shell 1.0 +

comments (#)
17. File as input which is going to deal with;
Simple shell 1.0 +

Usage: simple_shell [filename]
Your shell can take a file as a command line argument
The file contains all the commands that your shell should run before exiting
The file should contain one command per line
In this mode, the shell should not print a prompt and should not read from stdin


All the above explains what this project is all about

*****May the God's hand be with us during the coding session*****
